# webhook-sample

This is a sample of a webhook that can be used on any system (e.g. gateways) that will notify your application via a POST endpoint

## How to call the webhook using the sample

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the project: `$ cd webhook-sample`
3. Install dependencies `$ npm install`
4. Run the server `$ npm start`

### Calling the webhook

The server will run on port 8080 on your localhost (When you go to production, you will have to use a different domain). 
You can either do a curl command or use a curl client application (e.g. POSTMAN)
